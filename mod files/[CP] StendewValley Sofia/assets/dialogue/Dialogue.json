  "Introduction": "So you want to ride the yacht to get to the private island?#$b# You poor unfortunate soul.#$b# I used to work for them you know, and even now that I'm not employed I'm still helping#$b# Good luck cause you're gonna need it.",
  "Mon": "You know, as Sten’s TA the work was simple. I just had to grade and help students.#$b#Now, the man is just like: 'Oh you need to drive a boat... you don’t know how to do that? Then figure it out!'#$b#So, uh, sorry if it’s a bumpy ride.",
  "Tue": "There’s a monkey on the island who’s Sten’s best friend.#$b#His name is Paul, he’s a pretty cool dude. Sten hated him initially, but nobody can hate Paul for long.#$b#He’s just a little guy!",
  "Wed": "Oh, you want to know what the item is?#$b#Well, don’t look at me, I don’t know anything about that. I’m just here driving a boat for minimum wage.",
  "Thur": "I hope Sten tells you about how he got kicked out of the mainland, it’s a really funny story.#$b#He thinks it’s a joke between him and Mayor Lewis but... no, he’s actually banished from here.#$b#That’s why I drive the boat.",
  "Fri": "Oh, if you end up going into Sten’s house, could you look for a Junji Ito manga?#$b#He borrowed it a while ago from me but he lost it in his house.#$b#I tried going in there once, but it was disgusting... Maybe you shouldn’t go in there, actually.##$b#I’ll just buy a new copy.",
  "Sat": "Fun fact: did you know the first mod Sten ever installed in Skyrim was Killable Children?#$b#I mean, I can’t blame him if I played Skyrim I would probably get it too... but that should tell you a bit about the guy you’re dealing with."
